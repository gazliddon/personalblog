Wow, this was nice and a cheapo cut of meat, a skinned chicken thigh from a Tesco value box of them. I just cut the bone out of the thigh, flattened it a bit and sprinkled some dried rosemary and thyme on it. Fried it on a medium heat in olive oil, 4 mins each side along with some sliced mushrooms.

The salad was crispy leaves, baby spinach, raspberries, sliced jalapenos, torn up tomato then seasoned and tossed with MCT oil. And it was amaze. A little tasty oasis of early morning calm before Charlie's fifth birthday today.


# Why Am I Embarrassed About The Cheapness?

I am a bit but I don't know why. I don't know, I really can't tell the difference between that and more expensive cuts we used to buy. Maybe it's masked by the herbs and seasoning but the end net effect is something just as tasty as an organic cut costing double the price.

A few months back we looked at our shopping bill and worked out what we could trim or change to what had become a major expense for the household. Suzey has done a brilliant job with this and we eat really well, probably better than we ever have. We throw less away than we ever have and buy a lot of value items rather than branded goods.

So win / win all around? It is and though it's mostly gone now I did spend a bit of time feeling a bit weird about it. Ridiculously it felt like I'd sort of failed a bit in wanting to spend less for food for our family that had less -perceived quality- despite not being able to find any real discernible difference in the food itself. That and likely tied in with some kind of latent snobbery I wasn't aware I had. I guess I'm supposed to feel this way and it's exactly the reaction corporations hope they'll get from the billions they spend on decade long marketing campaigns.

If you make something like Heinz Ketchup and the truth is that actually there's very little palpable difference between you and your competitors then you're in a commodity market and the only way to win in that is a price war, a place no one wants to be.

So yeah, just a bit odd that a change in the way we feed ourself that is so utterly positive in anyway I can measure is also bound up with some irrational feelings lingering around the edges of shame and embarrassment. It almost feels like I'm being unfaithful to Coleman's Mustard or Heinz Ketchup :D
