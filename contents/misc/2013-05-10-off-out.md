**17:59** Off out for a run. It's been a few days since I last went and I'm way off plan. At least the rain has stopped. Looks a bit windy out though. Not feeling it but off we go!

**20:48** Yeah pretty good, 10km and very grindy to start with. But I got into it and my pace seemed to go up. I can't confirm it though, -thought- I'd started my Garmin but obviously hadn't so I've no record. Balls. I'd say it's around the 57m mark. Pushed hard but it was very windy. Another 10km and I'll be back on track for 30km in total this week
