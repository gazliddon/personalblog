[WriteRoom][writeroom] is a brilliant app, nice and simplistic text editor by the fabulous [Jesse Grosjean][jesse], author of, among other things, [Folding Text][ftext]. Well worth checking out.

## 
What's nice about all of Jesse's apps is they're javascript based and in turn easily theme able with some HTML and CSS hacking.

And that's lead us here, a brilliant C64 theme for WriteRoom by [pixelgrind](http://www.pixelgrinch.com/) :)

Enjoy!
