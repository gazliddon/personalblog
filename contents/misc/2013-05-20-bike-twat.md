Kapow! Idiotic, I've not fall off my bike for a while but decided to do so again this morning. Riding through the concourse of the Ruffibuilding I hopped off the seat onto one peddle and put the brakes on. Into a forward sommersault, right in front of Dave Hoare who was holding a door open for me. Ouch. Won't be doing that again :) Probably.
