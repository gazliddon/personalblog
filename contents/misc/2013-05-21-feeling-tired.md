**08:19** Not so tired now :) Pretty happy with that run, only 5km but a slight return to form. One of my short term goals was < 25m for a 5km again and on what was a fairly relaxed run I took a step towards that with a 24:47m time. Nice. It's really nice out there right now, good weather and not that windy either. The Tay is a beautiful place this time of day, I'm really lucky to have this place

**06:38** Feeling a little bit physically flat recently and I've slipped on my running and riding a bit. I think it's a combination of some longer level fatigue from a pretty large increase in exercise and my diet going a bit shit. So a little push this week with the plan of cutting out dairy and red meat and upping veggies. To be fair even when my diet is 'bad' it's much better than it used to be.

A while back we cut out processed food completely and me and Suzie don't really eat anything that's not home cooked from fresh ingredients. It's been a surprisingly easy change hugely helped by Suzie being a fantastic cook :D A bit of a look at how we were spending our money also meant a drastic reduction in our weekly shopping bill too. All in all a win / win.

I think the recent weariness has in part been down to a pretty poor sleeping pattern as well, I've been up at around 3am for the last week or so. Cutting out caffeine in the evening should help that. No coffee last night and I got 8 hours + in. That's pretty amazing for me as 6 hours is my usual max. Feeling pretty chipper right now, had a really nice breakfast and going to head out for a run in a bit.
