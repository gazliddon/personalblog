Another couple of weeks left on the running program I started a while ago to try and get back into it and I'm getting close to the goals I initially set myself. [Yesterday got me close to the sub 25m 5km](http://zeropager.com/misc/2013-05-21-feeling-tired.html) I'm aiming for and today I was 2 seconds off the sub 55m 10km.  It'd be a lie to say I'd given either run race quality levels of effort. The goals aren't particularly aggressive but it's good to be close to hitting them early.

[Details here](http://app.strava.com/activities/55618374) 

Next up I'll need to work out a plan to hit what are pretty aggressive goals (sub 50m 10km, sub 23m 5km) that'll have some interim milestones or I'm never going to get there.

That path I run in the morning trails along side the railway track to Dundee and it was good to see ex-Ruffians John and Dave Hynd just about to get on their train to [Rockstar](http://www.rockstargames.com ). Up until that point I felt pretty good about my form and pace but these guys are awesome runners, capable of sub 20m 5km so it was a bit of a kick up the arse. It was near the end of the run but my last 1k split
