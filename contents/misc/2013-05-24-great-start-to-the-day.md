Woo! Actually happy with both of these:

Man I'd really like that Tayside Run To The Ferry number one spot, only 8 seconds slower than the current fastest :D Strava's great for throwing up challenges like this.

That's me just after the run, a 10km that just scrapes under 53 minutes. Felt good, wasn't maximal effort by any stretch of the imagination and gets me past my short term goal of <55m for 10km. Next up a plan to get to sub 50 mins :)

And then after that a >30km/h average cycle into work. Yeah this is good and along with a great breakfast has me up nicely for the day. Bunch of important work stuff to do but I don't think I could feel more positive right now.
