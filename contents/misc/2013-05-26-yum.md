Wow! That was great. Suzey bought me some Alaskan Salmon in the week and on the very edge of the sell by data I've just scoffed it down. So easy to cook as well. Place each fillet on its own piece of tin foil, coat lightly on both sides with an oil (butter is good as is oil. I like MCT oil myself ). A bit of salt and some lemon juice. Bring the edges of the tin foil up over the salmon and pinch together to form an enclosed by loose parcel.

Bung in the over at 170 degs for around 20 minutes and then eat. Lush :)

## Food This Week

It's been pretty good. [I've kept away mostly from red meat and diary](/misc/2013-05-21-feeling-tired.html) and also felt full of energy and pretty good in general. So is that related? For the sake of science I eat pretty badly yesterday and did fuck all. And watched The Voice :) Felt crappy, what a surprise. Back to it today and the salmon is great start.

Just watching some morning kids TV with the boy but off out in a bit for run. Another 10km I think but a nice slow one today I think. Podcasts rather than dance music should help :)
