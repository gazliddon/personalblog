Happy-ish with [this][12km]. A few achievements:

* Extended my distance out to 12km
* Run and felt comfortable
* 53m 42s 10km
* Average pace under 5:30 min / km
* Got a runners high when the astounding drop [just after 49:40 on this track][soundcloud] hit

Yeah! Onwards and upwards innit but it's also been accompanied by a weird anxiety. More after the break.

## Running With Others

It's a bit odd but I've never really run much with other people. In fact it's only happened twice: the [Edinburgh BUPA 10km][bupa-10km] and a quick trot out with my bro-in-law. Both were great and I wouldn't mind doing some more so I've been eyeing up the local running club who meet on Tues / Weds nights. It's based out of the [local gym][david-lloyds] and talking to one of the organizers they do a 5km run that extends out to 8km for the adventurous.

I meant to go along last night but there's a bit of me that's kind of worried about my pace. I asked what sort of times people put and for the 5km it's between 24 and 32 minutes. This is silly as I should place somewhere in the middle even though it's a hilly course. Just to get an idea of where I'm at I even did a bit of a [hilly run][hilly-run] a few days back and managed an alright-ish 5:38 min/km.

It looks like I wouldn't wholly disgrace myself but it's odd, despite that and enjoying running with others the few times I've done it I still have some residual trepidation that's holding me back a bit. I need to put that behind me and make a concerted effort to get out next Tuesday :D I know I'd enjoy and longer term it should improve my running to, I just need to get over this silly anxiety :)
