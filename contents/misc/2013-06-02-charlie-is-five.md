Wow, Charlie is five today. I know it's a cliche but I'm amazed at how quickly that's gone. Had a quick peruse through some old Youtube vids yesterday evening with my Mum and Suzie, it's so odd to see him so wee and it seems like hardly any time has gone. This one's a favorite of mine.

Yesterday we had a party for him, run by the excellent and oddly named Steven Smellysocks, local kid wrangler who runs [A Star Sports](http://www.a-starsports.co.uk/local-classes/dundee-angus/). He's really great, the kids love him and despite a pretty big group of around twenty they all seemed to have a great time. No mean feat.

That's great, this is what it did to me though:

Suzey handled it a bit better :)

In fact she was great and built an amazing smartie and kit-kat cake that went down very well indeed. I need to get out running today as Vicky's fantastic chocolate cookies had me fall off the no carb wagon in a pretty major way. 10km this morning then :) First though it was an early rise and a lot of excitement over his main present, a brand new bike.

We'll get him out on that later, take him swimming and finish off the day with a trip to Nandos. Should be good. First up though he's getting to grips with Lego City: Undercover. Bit weird seeing the boy play a kid friendly GTA Clone but he's completely captivated and rightly so. The guys at Travelers Tales have made an utterly charming game.

Going to be a busy day.
