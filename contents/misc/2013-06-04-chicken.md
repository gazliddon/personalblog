Oh Bah! Was intending to go out with the local running club for the first time tonight. But I didn't. To be fair I was a bit knackered from the ride home and that played its part but really? Yellow bellied, lilly livered, pigeon hearted and rolling over for for the fears [I'd written about last week](http://zeropager.com/misc/2013-05-30-todaysrun.html).

That's pretty rubbish. Good thing is they meet tomorrow as well so I get another chance. It'll be a concerted effort to leave work a little earlier and ride home a mite less frantically so I'm fresh as a daisy for what will likely be a pleasant jog out :)

Stupid gaz.
