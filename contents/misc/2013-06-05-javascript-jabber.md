Hey! Quick link to something I really enjoyed on my way into work, the latest episode of [Javascript Jabber][jsjabber]. It's a podcast primarily concerned with developing in Javascript but like most single subject podcasts that have lasted for a while it tends to roam all over the map a bit.

And that's no bad thing as this week's is concerned with [Functional Reactive Programming][frp]. It's interesting stuff and they have as a guest the author of [Bacon.js][baconjs], an FRP lib for JS. What is FRP? Kind of helps if you know what FP is already but it seems to be a way of applying functional paradigms to a source that has a temporal aspect to it. See that all makes sense now :D

Anyway worth a listen. I do think it'd be something you could apply to games, particularly clear / easy tracking of high level goals you've set a player. Stuff you can do in a state machine it's just state machines have never been that readable to me.

So here it is!

**EDIT** : Found [this page](http://lambdor.net/?p=171) talking about moving from a component model to an FRP one. Not wholly sure these approaches constitute an either / or choice but it's an interesting read :)
