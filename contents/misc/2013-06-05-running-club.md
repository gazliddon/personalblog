Ha! Much as my rational side had predicted going to my first Running Club tonight was good fun. Foiled again [insecure, emotional side](http://zeropager.com/misc/2013-05-30-todaysrun.html).

Sports equipment retailer Sweatshop organise these across the country and we started in the Duneee branch based in the foyer of the local David Lloyd's. Tonight saw 10 runners all in all, all pretty friendly and a 50/50 split between men and women. On offer was the choice between a 5km or 8km course, the 8km adding an extra loop midway through to the distance up. Still feeling a bit of anticipation despite everyone's obvious friendliness and swamped a bit by the unfamiliar I opted for the 5km.

So off we went, a slower start than I'm used and right the beginning I ended up in a cluster of 4 MAMILs (middle aged men in lycra) who I felt good about keeping up with. Well for a while and I soon found myself fourth out of four. I haven't run with anyone else and  my pacing control is atrocious. I was fine for the downhill first half but fell right behind on uphill return to the start.

Even so, did the 5.5km in 28:42 and 5k in 25:53. An average pace of 5:13 m/km  which given the hillyness of the course is pretty good for me and step up from what I've been doing.


Everyone seemed very nice. It's a shame they have a relay event next week but I'm away on a business trip. After that though I think I'll definitely be back. Really enjoyed it and pushing myself on that course will help my pace I'm sure.

All in all THUMBS UP. The nervousness I'd felt was idiotic, it was great fun and helped eke a bit more effort out of me than I've managed on solo runs recently.

I got a bit of though is this business trip to the states. Every time I've gone their my exercise has slipped and I've gained around half a stone. To help that not be the case this time we're in a hotel [close to where I used to work][loews] that has some great running. The goal is to go out every day and try and resist the temptation of the awesome steaks that continent has to offer.

It's weird, the trip is for [E3][e3], the big annual show for the games biz  and previously I've always looked forward to and hugely enjoyed going. And this one is a bit special too; the industry I work in is in the throes of massive change. For years its rotated around the axis of big consoles from Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony. And this year it could be the last time we'll ever see a big console launch of that ilk. Micrsoft and Sony respectively have the XBOX ONE and PS4 on their first outings but for some reason they don't feel like the future.

I suspect we're entering an age where even television connnected game playing hardware may move to a model similar to phones. You get continuity in the OS layer but a high turnover and regular advancement of hardware. Maybe even bought by end users in a similar way where you subscription to the service for a fixed time subsidises the hardware cost.

I dunno. All I know is it'll be different and this show might well be the twilight of the gods.

Exciting stuff though but despite that I'd still rather stay at home this year. I got a load of stuff I could write about the whys and wherefores of this change of heart but it all comes down to one thing really. I'm getting on a bit. Oh well. Nearly done :D
