On the flight to LA and talking with Duncan about what we were both looking forward to at E3.

His point of interest was "what's Sony's next move?" There's so many things we don't know as yet: their online and connected offering, launch titles and on the most basic level what will it look like? All of that's going to be fascinating especially in the context of what MS have already announced. This is a pretty unique set of circumstances. I don't think there's even been two major consoles looking likely to launch in the same territories at around the same time.

So we have the big two, duking it out in downtown LA. Who wouldn't want a ringside seat for that?

I want to see all of that too. But when talking about the show I surprised myself about how interested I am in Nintendo's offering and for what turns out to be mostly selfish reasons. If I have to imagine myself playing vidya games over Christmas then it wouldn't be a surprise to see the Wii-U be my weapon of choice. Surprised? I was.

It's all about time and age.

Getting older has made any spare time increasingly valuable. It's rare as rocking horse shit and what I do get disappears alarmingly quickly. So I'm a lot less adventurous in my leisure choices than ever before; games, movies or books that you've got a pretty clear view of what you'll be getting appeal more than taking a risk on something I may end up not liking. On top of that family sensibilities are important to me now, anything we can all enjoy as a family, together or individually, understandably gets favoured. I'm moving towards the middle, beige gaming.

I've no insider knowledge on what any of the platform holders will be announcing but it wouldn't be a surprise to see Nintendo's longer in the tooth, more weakly powered Mario Box get a slate of titles likely to satisfy my increasingly staid gaming needs.

So am I saying Nintendo will offer surprise domination again this cycle? No. I'd be very surprised if they didn't come third.  Even though my proclivities and interests are not the majority's I do think there might be a Dad Gamer Massive with a significant amount of disposable income to spend on safe bets. Not  enough to win out but enough to narrow the gap  between 1st and 3rd and maybe enough to see still strongly in the game.

Will know more in a few days :)
