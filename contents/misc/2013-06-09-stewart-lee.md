<div>Is This Stewart Lee?</div>
</div>

Man, there's a guy 3 rows down from the me and I think it might be [Stewart Lee](http://www.stewartlee.co.uk/). I mean the back of his head looks really familiar and I've managed to catch a glimpse of him in profile and there's nothing suggesting it isn't Stewart Lee.

Well apart from the fact whoever it is has spent much of the last three hours playing an electronic fruit machine on the in flight entertainment. I don't know why but its hard to believe Stewart Lee would do something like hat.

Even ironically

Maybe thats talking more to my snobbish tendencies than saying anything about what Stewart Lee would or wouldn't do on a flight to Newark. Its hard cheese for me. There's disappointment either way, by it not being Stewart Lee or it is Stewart Lee but he loves playing horrible fruit machine games.

I don't know. I'll try and grab a proper gander on the way out.
