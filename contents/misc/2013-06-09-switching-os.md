Ha. That was pretty good. I'm quite enjoying the odd random bit of development right now and in particular being part way through an experiment to swap operating systems for a bit.

The plan has been to switch my home development away from Mac and onto Linux though I'm not really sure what's prompted. So I've now now had a few days using a [Dell XPS 13 laptop that comes pre installed with Linux][sputnik] and all in all it's been pretty enjoyable. Despite the change being really recent  I've kind of known I've been heading in that direction for a little while and have been stealth prepping for this switch.

First was to move to some more cross platform apps on the app. It was a bit rough at first, all of efficiency and muscle memory built up over years of using the same software went out of the window and to be honest I felt a bit of a dunce for a while. It's not a great feeling going from proficiency to deficiency but it turns out that despite being unpleasant for a week it's not so bad. The biggest changes were dumping Safari in favour of [Chrome][chrome] and [Emacs][emacs] ousting [Sublime Edit][sublime]. What was a surprise is that just those two apps covered a pretty huge amount of what I use a home development laptop for.

The thing that struck me is desktop / laptop usage is staring to migrate away from being defined by the choice of operating system you choose to run. There's a significant proportion of key tools I use have a platform neutral, web based interface available and are services rather than installed software tied to a certain way of doing UI. Good examples for me are [Evernote][evernote], google reader, Google apps, [Dropbox][dropbox].

I think both MS and Apple can see the way that the wind is blowing, Both of them enviously eyeing Google's dominance in services and investing billions to catch their lead while Google are making their own moves towards supplying an OS with Android. I can honestly see operating systems move more and more towards just supplying a browser frame for the much quicker moving and innovative world of web applications and services.

I suppose the type of dev I've been messing with (mostly web work) is by it's nature platform agnostic and I've had no problem bring across technologies like Ruby or node onto the new machine. If I'd been doing more traditional C++ games work it'd take a bit more time and effort to get things working nicely. From what I've read Linux is the messiest of the big 3 operating systems in terms of building software that will run nicely on a broad group of OS versions / HW. But even that may change over time; a big uptake the long rumoured [Steambox][steambox] could well correct that anomaly.

So yeah, early days but the move to Linux has been interesting, not all hat jarring and for someone like me, never more engaged than during upheaval and change, fun. I'll still be on a Mac for work and in turn on a [windows VM][para] for the exceptionally small amount of important things but I wonder how that balance will shift in the next few months.
