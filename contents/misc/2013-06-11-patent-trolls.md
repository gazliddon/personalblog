I've [previously blogged about][previous-tal] the fantasticness of the [This American Life][tal] podcast. It's kind of weird and probably a bit of snobbishness on my part but to be honest I've always associated excellence in radio with the BBC. It shouldn't be a shock that other people are good at it and honestly I should be ashamed that part of the shock is due to that excellence coming from the states. But it does.

This is probably one of the best podcasts I have ever listened to, a brilliant and in depth multi-year investigation into a the world of patent trolling. Genuinely impressed with amount of effort and depth of though that has gone into this episode.

The page to download it is here or you can stream it below:

Yep, it kind of revolves around technical issues but you don't need to understand all of that, this is a brilliant detective story with greed at it's core. Utterly fascinating. You really should listen to it.
