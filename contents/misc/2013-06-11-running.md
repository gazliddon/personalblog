<div> New Shoes! </div>
</div>



Managed to get to a [decent sports shop today][shoeshop] (Top To Top on Wilshire Blvd and 26th) and pick up some new running shows. I've been pretty happy with the [Nike Free 3.0][[oldshoes]] I've had for the last 6 months or so, they're comfy to wear, quite light and a medium minimalist design with a 4mm drop between heel and forefoot. I had some similar Saucony's prior to that and feel pretty at home with that kind of minimalism for my running. So if everything is going well then it's obviously time to try and muck it all up with a change. So I picked up some [New Balance Minimus 10v2][newshoes], an even more minimal design with a zero mm drop and a sole from minimal run specialists, [Vibram][vibram].

Not had a decent run in them yet, will do that when the sun rises this morning but the quick go around the block was familiar, it felt kind of similar when I moved from standard soled trainers to a more minimal design. A bit more pressure on my shins and calves but a good feeling of connection to the running surface. We'll see how it goes but if a bit of short term lower leg pain turns up it wouldn't be much of a surprise :)

# Yesterday's Run

Had a nice trip out yesterday. The [hotel I'm staying at][hotel] is really close to Santa Monica beach so it's a short stroll west and onto a beach side cycle track heading north towards Malibu. Went out a sun up before the socal sun managed to get it's heat out and did around 6km at 5:13 min/km. That's okay :) I want to see if I can extend out to 10km this morning but will take it easy with the new shoes.

# Fitbit

<div> The breakable Fitbit One</div>
</div>

The run coupled with a pretty nice walk from the [XBOX Media Event back][xboxevent] to downtown gave got some good stats on [fitbit.com][fitbit]. What's that then gaz, I imagine I hear you saying? Well a fitbit is a wearable motion detector device that tracks your movement, uploads the data and allows you to work towards general activity goals. There's a bunch of pretty well respected research that links ongoing light physical activity with general well being and [sitting on your arse with a lot of not so nice maladies][sitting-bad]. In the job I'm in it's pretty easy to not walk about much but as I respond pretty well to numerical goals it should be a match made in heaven.

Well it is now but getting there has been a bit of a pain. This is the 3rd fitbit device I've had after breaking two Fitbit One models. I'm a big clumsy oaf but really some of the blame for the breakage lies with the design of the One. They're not cheap but are pretty flimsily made and oen of the advised way of wearing them, clipped to a belt, puts a lot of straing on the plastic housing which was what broke for me twice.

</div>

I've now got the newly launched, wrist worn FLEX and so far it's been great. It's comfy to wear, easy to keep on at all times and feels well made and sturdy compared to its predecessors. You lose the dot matrix display but some UI design based around a line white LEDs, vibration for feedback and tap detection for user input works really, really well. On top of that it now syncs with my iPhone which then punts on the day's stats to fitbit.com

The steps per day I'm aiming for is 10,000. Yesterday's run and stroll got me to an excellent 15k :) Hoping for something similar today.
