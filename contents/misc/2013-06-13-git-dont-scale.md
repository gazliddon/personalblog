Really enjoyed this, a talk about scaling github into the 400lb gorilla it is today. Ostensibly a technical talk abut ultimately about the philosophy of getting things done rather than doing stuff for the sake of it.

I like that sort of discipline probably because I can find that hard sometimes :)
