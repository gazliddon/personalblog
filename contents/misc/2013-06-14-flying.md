I need to get to Southampton for early afternoon Saturday which in turn means the only option for the return from LA is a tortuous journey via Toronto. With a six hour stop over.

Ace.

And I just bought a new t shirt to switch into mid journey just to minimise the grimey feeling you get from air travel. Thought it was plain black but it turns out to have a big bear's face on it. Class.

It's going to be a fun 24 hours.
