Hey! That was great! Got back to the UK yesterday in time for the wedding of the excellent Richard Nutman and now Nikki Nutman (ne Getzig). We've known this guys for a good long while from our south coast days and it was a privilege to be there for the ceremony and reception after. Also great to catch up with a shed load of other pals from southern England. And all in the bucolic environs offered by the New Forrest. The last week's been fun at E3 but it's pretty tiring too so reuniting with Suzey and Charlie at such a nice occasion was a great Brucey Bonus too.

Today we're off to bro and sis in laws where we'll also catch up with the in-laws and luxuriate in the awesomeness of the Adventure Time t-shirt that Father's Day delivered me.

Here's some pics. Only had the iPhone on me but some have come out okay :)
