I wanted to write something about this because it's been a delightful gift :)

It's easy to get into a bit of a rut sometimes, stick to middle lane keeping well away from anything new or unfamiliar. And it's kind of rotten so sometimes you need to take a little bit of positive action to bump the needle out of the groove and onto something new.

How do you do that? Asking a load of other people what to do usually works for me. For better or worse I have around 800 Facebook friends as a hive mind are incredibly wise and have rather excellent taste.

So I asked this:

````
Hello there Facebook Chums!

On the lookout for some MUSIC RECCOMENDS! Fancying some glitched up electronica. Anything along the lines of Jazz Jaggaist or Jackson and his Computer band would be ace. I think I need something sharp and brittle after getting numbed out a bit Daft Punk's latest. Which was nice, just a bit bored of it now.

Any help super gratefully received
````

And go a lot of great suggestions. And not so great ones. But mostly really great ones. What stuck most though is this, Immunity by John Hopkins. It's on spotify here:

And at the start of the post? It's a lovely video of probably the best track on the album.

Moral of the story, if you don't know what to do then just let someone else decide. Outsource your taste :D
