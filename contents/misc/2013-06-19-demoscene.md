I like [Timothy Lotte's blog](http://timothylottes.blogspot.co.uk/). A lot. It's been a great source of information about game oriented rendering techniques. There was some change at some point where he's stepped back from writing about his render work and now mostly links to just CG related interesting stuff. That's a bit of a shame but he has great taste and I particularly appreciated this post collecting together youtube vids of some recent missives from the demoscene :)

Enjoy!
