Messing around with a tiling window manager called [i3](http://i3wm.org/). It's a really minimal, keyboard oriented approach to Window management and I really like it! So far. There's a video introduction above.

Only trouble is the keyboard repeat rate defaults to something I don't like. I need to get this in my boot up config for i3 but for now? This is how I like it:

<pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
xset r rate 300 40
</pre>
