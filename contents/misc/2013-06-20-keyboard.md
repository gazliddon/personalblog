Messing around with a tiling window manager called [i3](http://i3wm.org/). It's a really minimal, keyboard oriented approach to Window management and I really like it! So far. It fits in quite nicely with the recent push I've had towards text mode and less GUI frippery over the last few months. Not sure if that will last, [Mavericks](http://www.apple.com/osx/preview/) also looks tempting, but I'm enjoying it for now and finding it really productive for me. To get a better idea of what i3 is all about though there's a video introduction above.

Only trouble is the keyboard repeat rate defaults to something I don't like. I need to get this in my boot up config for i3 but for now? This is how I like it:

<pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
xset r rate 300 40
</pre>

Nice :)
