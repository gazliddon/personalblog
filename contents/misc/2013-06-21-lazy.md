I'm having a bit of trouble getting [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com/) working under Linux. Well I say trouble but the truth is I haven't tried very hard to get it going. I was sort of half successful with Wine but I get a lot of drop outs when playing.

So I moved onto the web player which kind of works in that I can play suggestions, radio stations but none of my own playlists or anything I actually search for.

And it's been wholly excellent. I've listened to a load of music this morning that I haven't heard before. Got served up the new tracks from the familiar [Aphex Twin](http://www.drukqs.net/) and [trentem√∏ller](http://www.anderstrentemoller.com/) along with some great sounds from [Jonsi & Alex](http://jonsiandalex.com/)

Hoorah for my laziness! It wins again!

That said if anyone knows what I'm doing wrong it'd be good to know :D

**EDIT** Weird! Logged out. Logged in. And it now works. Back to me rut
