Hey! Great weekend all in all. I'm late to blogging it but there you go. Suzey and her excellent chums Sammy Thomson and Angela Bisset took part in the Race For Life at Camperdown Park on Sunday. They all completed 5km and did brilliant, raising > Â£200 to give cancer a rightly deserved kick in the cobblers. Less chat more pics. There's a load below and you can find [the entire set linked right here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gyratory/sets/72157634286617440/)

Maybe you want to help it and contribute a bit of cash for this sterling effort? It's not too late you know, the Just Giving page is open for a few more weeks yet. Go on, you know you want to :)
