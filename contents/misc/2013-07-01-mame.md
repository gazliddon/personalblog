This has made me happier than it should a man is his forties I now have [Mame][mame] running on my laptop. More specifically it's [Rainbow Islands][ri] and [Bubble Bobble][bb] that have delivered the grins.

That shouldn't be too hard to do should it? Well. A combination of running Ubuntu and having stupidly finicky standards about certain things meant it eat up a big of my weekend time.

<img src='/misc/img/nerdcat.jpg' style='float:left;margin-right: 10px'> Well. The main issue I had was not being able to get Mame running with vsync working. It wasn't to do with Mame itself, I had the same issue on anything that was supposed to sync to vblank just not bothering leading to a load of nasty tearing.<br><br>

Really can't be doing with that. Years ago, in another life, I was a programmer of video games for what now are massively under-powered systems. Even so EVERYTHING was about smoothness and frame-rate. If you couldn't keep at 60hz then you shouldn't. Can't flip screens without a tear? Go home. And that's been lost of late. Modern gaming somehow went down a wrong turn where that kind of shit was acceptable and eventually so common place people have become blind to it.<br><br>

It's promising that at the last E3 at the launch of the new consoles that 60hz was now being touted as a feature, something that people want. I hope that turns out to be the case, a return to the golden age of video gaming where anything that was important happened in under seventeen milliseconds. I have high hopes.<br><br> 

Anyway. My nasty horrid tearing happened on videos, games, anything really and was driving me up the wall. Unfortunately the laptop I'm using had a similar but actually different problem with similar side effects and I spent a shed load of time and effort trying to solve that issue.<br><br>

Eventually it become apparent that the problem was with [unagi][unagi], a composition manager I'd installed a few days ago. It just fucks up fucks up vsync. A revert to compiz cured my ills. I mean I got there in the end but man was it painful!
</div>

But it all works now. Now this makes some of my friends cry a bit but I running [Advance Mame][amame] and taking full advantage of some fancy shaders. Basically it's a way of dropping the chunky pixel look in favour of some jacked up, smoothed out, almost painterly style.

Some of the more purist of my retro loving chums equate this to dissolving puppies in a big vat of acid. I don't care, I love it. I got a 60hz, frame locked awesome game looking like it's been rendered in designer's gouache.

<div style='margin: 10px 10px;'>The blobbed up, non pixelly, scaled graphics that emulation now offers for games like this. And it tends to twist the panties of those who're hard core retro games (I'm looking at your FIL) but you know what? Fuckem</div>
</div>


I mean the original was on a proper old fashioned cathode ray tube and that looks nothing like scaled up pixelated graphics on an LCD monitor. All reproduction is corruption in it's own way, I've just chosen a prettier lie :)

What's a bit sad though is we have an original machine in the office but I can't be bothered to go an turn it on.
