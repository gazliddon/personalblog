Man, it must sound like I'm [This American Life][tal] shareholder or something but I don't care. As [I've said before][olderblog] this is a consistently exceptional podcast and worthy of anybody's time.

Today I'm frothing about a live show performed on stage earlier this year that was broadcast live across a bunch of US cinemas. It's great and the appropriate theme for a move from radio to on stage performance is [The Invisible Made Visible][podcast].

There's a lot be had her. A very moving and funny story of a guy going blind and how that's impacted his relationship with his daughter, an amazing piece about synchronicity and nineties pop songstress Taylor Dayne plus  something I hugely identified with, an anger fueled rant about coffee shop rage.

The [audio version can be checked out right here][podcast]. It's an hour long, half the size of the original show which had a bunch of visual elements that really didn't fit in a podcast. But that's cool because you can [<span class="label label-warning">download the video of it here</span>][video] and also watch the trailer below :)

Yep, it costs five bucks for the full video but I'm going to get it. Zero qualms about supporting exceptional work like this and long may they prosper. Hope at least someone reading this does the same :D

Enjoy!
