My running is picking pace but it's weird because I can't notice it when I'm actually moving along. Last night I went to the [Sweat Shop][sweatshop] organised [RUN CLUB][runclub] again and it was a great [6km jaunt][thisrun]. I'm really enjoying the vibe at RUN CLUB and starting to chat to some of the regulars and just running with other people is a nice change too. Lorna, the managere is really friendly. Mentioned not being able to come next week because of [biz trip to Brighton][dev] and she found a run for me there next week :)

The route from Sweat Shop is a bit like Fighting Fantasy role playing book, you get a few choices where to extend out the distance a bit. The shortest is 6km and the longest clocks in at 8km. I'll do the 8km. Oneday. But just not yet.

Last night was great though and I managed to get back first of all the people doing the shorter route. Yeah I know It's absolutely not a race but you can't help but see how you're doing in comparison to the others. Some of the faster runners I'd seen before hadn't turned up and there were a couple definitely quicker than me who went for the longer 8km distance. I don't think it'll happen much in the future so I'm savouring it for now :)

Even so I was a bit quicker, looking at the Strava my pace for the Tuesday night course has gone up to 5m25s per km from [5m36s on my first go][lastrun]. It's probably the hilliest course I do around here but the aim would be to get my pace under 5m15 in the short term. I think I can do it. I need to do it. This:

is starting to get on my tits. My mate keeps upping his 10km pace, is regularly under 50 minutes and every time he does it I get tagged on Facebook to his time with EAT THAT LIDDON! or some other equally charming text underneath. Nice :D


Anyway. I've got a plan.

I had a look over [my running records][records] to see how much running and what kind I was doing when my pace was a lot better. It was last Sep / Oct and funnily I was just running a lot more, 187 km in Oct, an average of 6km a day! So I want to get back to that order of distance again and then hopefully my pace will lift too.

It's a bit trickier this time around as I'm bike commuting now and that takes a bit of a toll. So the plan is to maybe bike commute 3 days a week and bus it the other 2 while aiming to hit 50km a week again.

I'm taking it gradually and set myself a 30 day plan with the aim of getting back to that weekly level by the end of July.

Here's hoping :) First steps are just to try and run 5km every day until Sunday. Next week will be tricky, I'm off to the Develop conference so the aim is run every day while on a business trip.
