Woo! Good running last night, second night in a row with [RUN CLUB][runclub] too. Slower than my [last try at this course][lastrun] but it was FLIPPIN HOT.

I've decided I really don't like the heat. In fact I found out what I really like is a bit of rain :) It was sopping [coming in this morning][ride] though not cold and I really enjoyed the ride.

I think the heat coupled with the Murray match being in full flow put a few people off and only four of us set off. Managed to come in second but I don't think anyone was pushing all that hard to be honest. Jim came in first, he's loads faster than me. Really would be good to be able to keep up at some point.

Quite happy with how things are going though. Early doors on my 30 day exercise plan but I think it'll get done okay. Another 5km tonight but I'm heading to the Tay for a nice flat, easy run. I've enjoyed the last 3 5k routes since Monday but they've all been hilly and I'm getting a few knee and calf twinges. Easy ambling tonight from 7pm :)
