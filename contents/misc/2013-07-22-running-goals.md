That is where I am and where I am and where I have to get to. Pretty sobering. Also every extra stone makes you 3 minutes slower on 10km and I'm 1 stone heavier than I've been in the recent past.

Taken [from here](http://www.mcmillanrunning.com/). The formula used for these pace calculators are pretty good, it worked out my full distance times pretty well just from my current 5km.
