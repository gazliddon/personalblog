Man there are a lot of people running. Why is that?

I was at a [games industry thing](http://www.developconference.com/) a few weeks back and was pretty much astounded by all of the runners coming out of the woodwork. Tonnes of em. A few years back the bar would have been awash with pissed up developers telling stories about the time FATTY got drunk out of his head and ended up pissing of the back of a double decker bus into traffic down Sunset Boulevard (names changed to protect the innocent)

This year it was run chat. Times, equipment, routes and a lot of it from the people mostly likely to be pissing into the high street from a big red bus.

One of the guys I was talking to had a theory and it goes like this:

We work in an industry of clever guys living mostly unhealthily for a good part of their career. It's easy to be sedentary, booze culture is big and it's not unusual to eat really badly if you're going through crunch. So his theory was these smart guys get into their forties and go through some sort of health scare. And being bright enough to take it seriously and do something positive it's not unusual to end up on a path that leads to running.

Certainly describes my experience pretty well.
