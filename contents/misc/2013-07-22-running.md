<div>Gah! It smells like bizwank but is actually spot on. What a tedious picture to put on a blog entry :) </div>

I wanted to have a think about how I'm exercising and what I'm doing. It's been a bit sporadic of late and that's a shame: I have the will and the energy but I don't think I'm using those resources to their best effect. I certainly feel I'm getting behind on my running but thinking about it that's the thing I enjoy most and want to make progress on.

Biggest surprise was that it makes sense to do at least one run into or out of work a week. It's weird because that feels a bit daunting but really it's just 10km, I can do them. What's more it should be a gentle, easy 10km. From all of the running training literature I'm reading right now the gentle, longer runs are really important. Despite trying I find it hard not to try. I need to try and sort that :)

## Anyway

Sometimes I just like doing a brain dump, organising that into similar categories, bullet pointing it all and then seeing what falls out in terms of conclusions. I mean who doesn't? It's a great way to have fun! Here's my exercising thoughts and conclusions

- I enjoy exercise now

- Though haven't been doing as much as I want
  - 8km running last week :(
  - I want to be back up to 50km
  - But I'm cycling now and that takes a toll
  - And I'm slow, getting faster but still not 24m or below for 5km

- Running
  - I love running
  - It's great for weight management
  - Good for my health
  - Competition is really good fun
  - Want to go faster and further while I still can
  - Not running enough
  
- Cycling
  - Really enjoy cycling
  - Not as much as running
  - Not as important to me as running
  - Aiming to be a one car family
  - Great for commuting
  - Listen to pod-casts / music
  - Impinges on running
	- Can make me too tired to run
	- I have to get to work, running is optional

- So
  - Less cycling and more running
  - Work out how to have running not impacted by cycling
  - Or anything else
  - Need a plan :  Run to a goal

- Ideas
  - Continue with bus commute on 2 days a week
  - Leaves me fresh for run club
  - Run commute 1 day a week!
	- Sounds scary
	- But it's a lazy 10km isn't it?
  - De-stress some of the running
	- I need to slow pace / longer distance running so do it
  - De-stress the cycling
	- I don't have to go fast (SANIC)
	- Go slow
	- Break up journey? Coffee shop is good

- Plan
  - Need to plan for running and do less cycling
  - Research running plans / can I make the above work with a running speed improvement plan?
  - Set gradations of success
	- Win / lose doesn't work well for me. Lose enthusiasm if I can't win :D
	- Set min - max distance
  - Set review points? 3 * blog posts for this week?

- Also
  - Fuck, I need to get my car sold really. It's just sitting in the drive not being used and costing me money. I don't want or need it but would like the lolly to help towards a deposit on buying a house in Scotland
  - Shake a leg!

So there we are. This is for my benefit more than anyone else :D The plan I came up with is here:
