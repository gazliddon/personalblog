Man, dealing with Royal Mail is frustrating.

Totally my fault for leaving an iPad mini and some running shoes in a hotel room a couple of weeks ago. The hotel were great, all of the items found fine and sent promptly for next day special delivery. Unfortunately quite a few next days have passed since them and no sign of my package. The tracking site just tells me it's on it's way.

One phone call later this is the upshot:

* It was sent on the 15th
* It was in Edinburgh on the 16th
* I DUNNO
* Nothing, absolutely nothing more can be done until it's classed as a missing item
* Which will happen on the 30th
* At that point a P58 form has to be filled in and sent by the sender to include
  * Proof of sending the mail originally
  * Receipts of the items being claimed for
* And they will 'try' and get back in touch within 30 days

Fuckers.
