So I set myself [a plan for last week][xls] that included easing off on cycling with the aim of boosting my running mileage. [Here's the original rambling post][plan]. How did it go?

Pretty good I'd say and it's landed me half way between silver and gold according to the win criteria I set myself. I learn a few things:

## I like commute running
This was a surprise as I'd planned on one commute run but ended up doing four. They're hard but pretty enjoyable. Pacing is a problem for me and at the start of the week I was starting out way too fast. That left me horribly knackered after and hobbling up and down the stairs at home like an old man. With rickets. Pace control got a bit better further into the week and post run fatigue started to lower. I think I can keep this up :)

## Easing Down The Riding Helped
I rode less this week and also at a less eager pace and I'm pretty sure that left more in the tank for running. It also left more in the tank for cycling funnily enough. After running in to work on Friday and then cycling back in the evening I managed to get my best time up the vile Grange Road.

And by quite a margin.

## I Need To Run Without A Backpack
I can run in and out with a backpack and did do all week but it's not ideal. Friday in particular was bad. Despite pulling all of the many straps it to minimise any backpack bounce I got some pretty bad chaffing on my back only 1km on. So that meant running holding the straps for the rest of the way. I looked like a fucking idiot and on top of that it wasn't particularly comfortable.

In fact it's left me some eczema like scabs on my lower back. Not great.

But that's okay I can organise what I have at work and home so a pack isn't necessary. And it's at least 6kg in weight. I'm slow enough as it is and don't need a bit lumpy mass on my back making things worse.

## Commute Is Great But I Need Some Variation
The only downside is all of the runs were effectively long slow ones. I need a bit more variety in my training to hit my goals

## Planning
Yeah it's important. I am utterly convinced that without spending time laying out what I was aiming for this week my mileage would have been way down. That said I didn't really stick to that plan either :D I think the value is in the clear enunciation of the goals you're trying to hit. If you change course but still get to where you want that's okay.

## Gradated Success - It works for me
Setting out a band for success worked well this week rather than just having one headline distance that I either succeeded or failed at. I didn't hit the stretch goal but got beyond the bar minimum and adequate. Totally averted the danger of just giving up altogether by giving myself a bit of slack on 

## Upcoming Challenges
This week I'm on holidays with the family but need to make sure I keep up the inertia. I should write out a running plan and really try to stick to it. It's going to be tricky as it looks like where we're going is out in the sticks and I have no idea what the running conditions will be like. It should be a little easier as I won't be riding at all. We'll see. What would be nice is if I can get 20km done there and another 20km when I get back.
