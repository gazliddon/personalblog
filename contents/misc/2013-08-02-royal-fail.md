After my [recent adventures](http://zeropager.com/misc/2013-07-23-royal-fail.html) I phone up to try and get my package containing an iPad Mini and my running shoes.

I'm actually kind of hoping and expecting it's lost. I have all of the receipts needed to make a claim for replacements and I'd nip out and buy new stuff right now. Today! It's never so simple though is it? Here we go, in bullet points again:

* My package isn't lost! (Hoorah!)
* It's in the National Returns Centre in Belfast
* But they don't know why
* They do know that:
  * No attempt has been made to deliver it
  * They haven't sent it back to the original sender
  * They don't know who the original sender is even
* Even so, it's probably the senders fault, unclear address and all that
* Only I have a scan of their special delivery print out from their system with the correct address on
* So I point this out, they have a package with a tracking number that's associated with the correct address on their system
* This is where it's weird
  * "We can't keep a record of your address because it's illegal because of data protection"
  * Data Protection is tricky, complex and something you have to pay attention to
  * But it doesn't make it illegal for a parcel delivery company to keep a computer record of a parcel's delivery address while they're trying to deliver it
  * That would obviously be mental. I tell him that.
  * A lot of bluster at this point. Moves to the position of "We don't have access to your address here" and even denies he claimed anything to do with data protection legality
* So let's move on, they have my package so:
  * "When will I get my package then?"
* And now he does a thing, it's a thing I hate, it's when you ask a question that needs a direct answer but you get a story instead:
  * "Well I will send a re-delivery notice to the returns centre and they will find the package and then inspect the contents, repackage and then..."
* As I say, I hate it when that happens so I'm probably a bit ruder than I should be cutting him short
* And I do it but saying something utterly ludicrous, just so he can correct me and I'll actually get a time estimate, however rough
  * "So that would take a month then?"
  * "Yes, maybe around a month"
  * !
  * "To find a package you haven't lost and send it to the address you already have?"
  * "Yes, as it's special delivery we prioritise your request!" (he says this really cheerfully)
* I lose it a bit now, you don't really want to hear about all of that

GNNNFFFFFF

Actually it strikes me that:

* 20 days passed before they would even look into classing this as missing
* On the deadline they say it definitely isn't missing
* But it'll be up to another 30 days before they find and send the package they haven't lost
* So I can't claim for it

What I'd like is that in the next month I get my stuff. What I suspect is on the deadline some other nugget of unexpectedness will pop up that means I won't get my package and I won't be able to claim for it either.

And they set the barrier to claiming pretty high, the onus is very much on the person who sent the package to do the leg work. I suspect there's a lot of people that never get their goods, don't have reciepts to prove the original purchase price and just give up.

In fact a cursory googling shows they make a good old bit of money from auctioning off undelivered packages:

Nearly a million quid in 2011

Cunts.
