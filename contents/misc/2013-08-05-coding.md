Good Lord. Just found out the little Javascript spritey thing I've been playing about with has been running un-accelerated on my machine all along.

That's pretty amazing to me as it's been pretty much solid 60hz all along. I only noticed after running the thing on an Ubuntu desktop machine at work and got some nasty tearing. That just didn't seem right as it's a relatively pokey machine. A closer look at chrome:flags showed that both my laptop and desktop were defaulting software rendering.

So I switched it on and now it just doesn't drop below 60hz for the majority of the time despite there being tonnes of sprites on screen. Nice :)
