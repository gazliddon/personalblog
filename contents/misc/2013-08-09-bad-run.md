Terrible run :) Got to just over 11km and had to walk and I hadn't been that fast up to that point either.

Possible contributory factors? Bit hot, 4kg backpack I hadn't laced up properly, bit of fatigue from earlier in the week? I dunno but my performance was worse than any of the previous run commutes. Sometimes it's just a bit shit I suppose. Felt good about doing it though and am looking like to hit my 50km goal for the week :)
