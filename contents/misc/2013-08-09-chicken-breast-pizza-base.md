Yesterday a mate asked about low carb alternatives to flour for which coconut and almond flours are pretty good candidates. But it's also dependant on what you're trying to make and I said my wife makes a pretty excellent pizza with a base made out of chicken breast, of all things :) There was a little interest in the recipe along with some other suggestions from the beautiful Suzey:


Okay dokey:  Chicken pizza base: 500g chicken blended with 2 eggs in a food processor. 

Spread out on an oiled (or greaseproof paper) baking tray or tin.  Bake in oven at about 180 (fan) for 20 mins, remove and add toppings. Return to oven for a further 15 minutes at 200 (fan).

On experience, for a pizza base I prefer the [cauliflower base](http://www.notquitenigella.com/2013/07/10/low-carb-gluten-free-cauliflower-base-pizza/) or the Rob Wolf cashew nut butter one.

If using chicken for pizza base I prefer the simplicity of the chicken pizza melt:

- Butterfly chicken breast and put on a tin foil 'base' on top of a baking tray.
- Spread top with tomato puree and italian herbs.
- Add toppings of choice (I like mushrooms, peppers and mozzarella or mushrooms, olives, onion and anchovies).
- Bake in the oven for 25 mins at 180-200 (fan).
