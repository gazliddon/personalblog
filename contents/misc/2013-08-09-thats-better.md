So [yesterday's shitty run](http://zeropager.com/misc/2013-08-09-bad-run.html) was just a blip I guess, this morning I completed the full 12.2km, was nicely invigorated after and did it all at an appropriate pace. It's what I've imagined a good long, slow, training run should feel like. V happy Gaz,

But yesterday was weird. I've no idea what sets me up for a good or bad run, the variables just aren't clear. Maybe they're not avoidable and just part of the process. Anyways, all in all pretty pleased with this week. There's only just over a k  to get me past the 50km weekly goal and I've the whole weekend to get it done in :D Aiming for a cheeky 5 on Sunday perhaps, might even try some intervals.
