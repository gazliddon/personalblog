Quick mid week catch up about running.

It's slow going (in so many ways) but yeah, coming on nicely. Right now I'm mid way through a second consecutive week of commute and it's been a lot easier than the previous week. That was a bit of struggle rife with ongoing aches and pains. This week though? So far I'm feeling very chipper, recovery times are decreasing, pace is slowly rising and the last Wednesday's midweek fatigue is nowhere to be seen.

Might even get to Run Club this evening. We'll see :)
