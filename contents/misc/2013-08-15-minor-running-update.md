So this run doesn't look special and to be honest it's not. Not very long, the pace pretty mediocre but I really feel like I've turned a corner here. So why is that?

So the difference is typing this right there's no discernible running related aches or pains and I've been like that within minutes of finishing the 12km run into work. And that's a big and positive change. Run commuting has been pretty enjoyable but the first week was pretty hard, characterised by old man hobbling around the office and feeling utterly wiped out. That seems to have gone now. Just one more run commute to complete this week, a short 7 km over the weekend to hit this week's 55km goal.

Pretty confident I'm going to hit it too and also pretty confident that's going to happen in a way that won't leave me physically wrecked. Good stuff :)
