A new Dungeon Keeper? I'm a man cursed with high hopes, always have been, so I'm insta-interested. Then this popped out of the internet yesterday:

I dunno. Am I right to feel repulsed? It's hard, I don't have the self awareness to understand what proportion of my ire is reasonable critical response,  kick up from an incredible font snobbery problem I have and just not sleeping that well of late. But I am repulsed.

I think it may the angry birds style chicken in the bottom right that's twisting my melon. One thing you learn from dealing with mega-corps of EA's size is that everything is though about in near excruciating detail. If it was there by accident I'd be very surprised.

What's all that got to do with the game? Nothing. At all. I loved Dungeon Keeper's original outing, it's glaringly obvious something fantastic could be made for IoS in the same ilk and so I'll be buying it terrible fonts and Beano-esque art style included.

So what am I moaning about? It's just they've got me haven't they? Because of all this promise I've made up in my head EA can shit in a box, scrawl Dungeon Keeper on the front in purple crayon and I'll still be coughing up the lolly. Because of my stupid high hopes. Gah, it's miserable work being optimistic sometimes.
