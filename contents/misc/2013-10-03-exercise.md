Well it's been a slack time recently and there's been a few reasons for that. I think the main is I've had a bit of knee trouble. I'm pretty sure I know what's wrong, self important middler ager + access to the internet means I'm just as good as any of those 'doctors' out there yeah?

But I've picked up my first exercise related injury and it's looking likely that I've got [iliotibial band syndrome][ilb]. Some nasty pains on the outside of the knee and there's been a bit of hobbling going on.

I did of a lot of [run commuting in August][rk] and that end of that the knee got a bit twingy. So I eased off a bit and did a load of cycling instead :D a lot of cycling instead. Quelle Surprise! That didn't help and I've had a few days off.

Today was the first ride into work for a bit and it was pretty good though my knee is kicking up a bit. So it's some abductor strengthening exercises and a bit iliotibial band stretching. Hoping I can bin this off in the next couple of weeks and start up running again :)

So what have I learned:

## I'm Not Superman
And that's a disappointment to be honest. I'd got a bit cocky coming late in life to exercise and not picking up and injuries for a good long while. Man I though I was invulnerable! I'm not.

## I should pay attention to minor pains earlier
Probably could have stemmed the problems earlier by responding to the warning signs back in August. I didn't. But in the future I will!

## Even so I've got fitter over time
Amazing that I'd now consider riding back and forth to work as rest :D But these days that's how it feels. Even an easy ride into work these days averages at 26km/h pace which was way out of my ability when starting. I'm pretty grateful for that :)
