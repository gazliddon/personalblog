Last week I had to learn about cloud stuff and I thought I'd write up what I'd found it. Yeah it's noddy stuff but I did find navigating some of the terminology and concepts a little tricky coming from my relatively naive background in these matters so I thought I'd jot it down as it may help others out there facing the same CLIFF OF LEARNING.

I admin a [small forum][yy] that for a long while has had an innapropriate hosting solution. It's something I set up nearly ten years ago and involved renting out a dedicated server from [UK2][uk2]. That worked pretty well. I learnt a lot of stuff about being a sys admin on a unix system and it offered stable and fast hosting for what was a pretty popular system.

There's some down sides though. The hosting cost never went down and year on year the spec of the server never went up. This is all stuff I could have sorted out but to be honest I was too lazy to deal with. It wouldn't suprrise me if a fair bit of the revenue that hosting companies bring in is through renting very old spec servers for high prices to people who don't want to deal with the hassle of moving everything to a new, faster and cheaper home. Can't blame them to be honest :)

But the world's changed a lot in the last decade. Our forum has less footfall than previously and there's a whole load of reasons for that but a large part would be the move to other social media platforms such as twitter, Facebook, Google+ etc Also for hosting costs have fallen hugely and there's been a rise in cloud hosting solutions. 

So I had a read about [Amazon Web Services][aws] and decided the transfer our site to them. A bit daunting and it meant learning quite a few things but ulimately? It's pretty awesome.

First off I found the terminology a little daunting and had to get my head around a bunch of proprietary Amazon TLAs (Three Letter Acronyms) as well as figure our from Amazon's huge range of offering exactly what it was I wanted to buy from them.

After a bit of study it looked like EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) covered what the forum needed. EC2 allows you to commision and launch instances. An instance is basically a server that launches in the cloud. Instances boot from images (AMIs) that are kind of like Linux Live CDs. You boot from them, they come online, you can do all of your servery stuff but when you reboot the server's state is reset to that of the image it booted from. You can fiddle with your instance after booting, install stuff you like, configure it how you want but you'll lose all of that on reboot. All you need to do though is once you have the configuration the way you like it is to make a new image that the instance will now boot from.

Okay that's great but what about persistent store? I mean the forum needs to keep all of those posts somewhere where it won't just disappear into nothingness? So for that you need to get an Elastic Block Store (EBS). This is a block device that you can attach to an instance and then format any way you want.

For our forum I put the mysql database and forum html onto the EBS and after configuring the EC2 boot image's web server software and mysql server pointed at the EBS store I'd attached. It works well.

The last thing I needed was an Elastic IP. This is basically a public IP address that you can connect to any of your running instances. I hooked one up to my forum EC2, got our guy who looks after the DNS records to forum to make the switch and it all worked fine :)

It's cool stuff. The type of EC2 I chose (a micro instance) and amount of EBS (3gb) that I commisioned all come within the free backet you get for your first year in using AWS. So it looks like the cost is going to be minimal compared to the grand a year that was being dropped on hosting.

And on top of that it all seems a lot faster as well.

And that's the story but to be fair it's victor's history in some respects. My first attempt wasn't quite so great, mostly due to a bunch of preconceptions on my part :D Here's how that went:

## Initial Attempt

First of all I just tried to replicate what we already had, a monolithic server that had no seperation between persistent data and a static boot image.

So I started by looking for a turnkey solution that would provide that on AWS. There are a lot of companies that will sell you a premade image for your instances and my first go was based around using the [Bitnami phpbb3 preconfigured image][bitnami]. That worked pretty well and I got it going really quickly. The downside was:

* It depended on using a EC2 instance with persistent store - this costs money to rent
* They took a pretty non standard approach to how the LAMP stack was installed - files in weird places etc
* And it was Apache, again
  * From time to time we've been flooded with a load of visitors and apache has never coped well with that
* And really, I know about this stuff. Do I need all of this handholding?

So I decided what I wanted was the structure I ended up with above on top of a fairly standard Linux distro with the web part of it served by nginx, a web server that can cope with a lot of connections far more efficiently than Apache. And I wanted to do so that the AWS resources used came into the free bracket.

## Amazing Flexibility
This is where using AWS really came into it's own. One of the great things is it enables you to quickly spin up new instances from boot images. I spun up a new one based on the standard Amazon Linux bundle and got to work installing all of the things I'd need. I managed to get the 1gb database copied onto an EBS, install the server software I needed and hook the new EC2 to the EBS containing the mysql data really quickly. I just added another Elastic IP and it was publicly testable and all worked :D From there I made a copy of the EC2 instance into a new image that the site would now boot from in the future.

After that put the old forum's Undergoing Maintainance sign up, shovelled over all the latest data and then pointed the elastic IP address at the new server and it all worked.

I'm bowled over by how easy it was to spin up and down servers in the cloud, commision and decommision storage and make radical changes to a pretty well used web site in a way that was mostly transparent to the end users.

So it's early days still but right now I'm sold :D
