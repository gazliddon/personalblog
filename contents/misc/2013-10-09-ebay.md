First purchase from EBAY today. A NES controller along with an extension lead. Hoping to chop them up so I can cobble together a controller I can attach to an AMTEL AVR. Making an exceptionally poor micro console inspired by this excellent demo and a thing called the Uzebox :) I've done a bit of work already and it's been fun learning some digital electronics.

Let's see how it goes. I've a load of techy rubbish at home that could well be of use to others out there so I'm contemplating flogging the lot of it. Little steps first though, let's see how this goes :)
