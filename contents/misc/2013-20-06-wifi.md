How do I choose networks when running a different window manager?

I'm on [i3wm][iw3m] and there's no system tray anymore.

Which in turn means no wifi network picker. It's been okay today as I have a [Huawei 3g wifi dongle][huawei]. Turn it on and my laptop already knows the credentials so it connects to that but no obvious way to connect to a brand new network and I'm sat in Starbucks and want to use their free Wifi.

I went down some false paths trying various command line-fu but it was painful and ultimately didn't work. So what I have now found out is  you can launch system tray apps in i3wm and they will appear along the bottom bar. To get the wifi one you need to run:

<pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
nm-applet
</pre>

It's part of the network-manager toolset. If you want to delve deeper the <code>nm-info</code> command is also worth a quick look at.

Hoorah! I need to get this running during i3wm boot up but that works fine for. Now on the [Aberdeen Starbucks][starbucks] Wifi while my Huawei battery gets a bit of rest. Less positively it's markedly slower than using the dongle but there you go :)

Next up fix the screen back light; coming out of sleep and it gets stuck on full and that's deadly for battery usage. I found a fix under Unity, pretty sure I'll be able to hunt down an equivalent easily enough.
