**17:02** About to get off and it's tipping down outside :( Falling off this morning and now about to get soaked. Not a great day for the bike.

**19:10** Well I missed rain and got out in time for the fucking hail. Less than 2 weeks to June and I'm being hailed on. It soon stopped and then the rain turned up. Fingers crossed for a better day tomoroow.
