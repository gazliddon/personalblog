Not a lot going on today for any of us. It's killer combination of bank hols and terrible weather. Absolutely tipping down outside and I'm looking at it contemplating a 10km run down the front.

It's doesn't look likely to be getting much better, strong winds and rain and only an hour long brief respite at 10pm tonight. It's not too bad, yesterday was pretty crammed and included a great trip to the swimming pool at [David Lloyd's][david-lloyd] 
. Charlie's getting really confident in the way and obviously loves it. His swimming is coming along beautifully, it's great to see. Also got a nice bit of time in the sauna and steam room :)

## Yesterday's Running
A bit of a weird one, I went out mid-day with the intention of doing a 10km but it just didn't happen. I got 2.5km in, felt a bit whacked, span around and headed back for the car. 5.2km in all but [a pretty crappy time of 27:18][runkeeper]. I really wanted to do 10km in total for the day so went out in the evening and went for the local hilly route.

Slower pace but my run up the hilly Grange Road was 3rd fastest so far, only a second off my all time best.

It's been great seeing Suzie make excellent way through Couch to Five K as well, the same program that got me into running last year. She's doing really well and now onto the longer, uninterrupted jaunts and should be hitting the 5km in one go mark pretty soon. I can see the same buzz and fervor in her that was such a surprise to me when I began. I got to go faster, she'll be catching me up at some point :)

## Frozen Synapse

Oh well. Going to fill the time with a little bit of programming and playing games. Realized last week I haven't played a game on my iPad for quite a long time and have always felt there to be a gap in my gaming education concerning the respected Gollop Brothers. I've never played [Laser Squad][lasersquad], [XCOM][xcom], [Rebelstar Raiders][rebelstar] or any of [Julian Gollop's][jgollop] ouvre despite having heard loads of people who's gaming sensibilities I respect rave on about them.

So the solution is [Frozen Synapse][frozen-synapse], high production value indie game and love letter to this genre that comes highly recommended. I got the recently released iPad version last week and hope to give it a go today.
